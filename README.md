## Example project included in the thesis "Kotlin Multiplatform for the Cross-Platform Development of Mobile Apps"
This project serves as an example of how Kotlin Multiplatform can be used to cross-platform develop an app for Android and iOS.

The v0.1 release also serves as a basic Kotlin Multiplatform project. It only contains the set up project and no use case-specific code.
